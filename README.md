---
The project aims to develop a prototype of a platform which can help streamline and scale up the
hiring process by automating the steps of recruitment that involve accepting applications,
gathering data and insights into the candidate pool, comparing candidates, ranking and
shortlisting all applicants. Such a platform could prove to be useful in carrying out large scale
recruitment campaigns by narrowing down the candidate pool for any specific job posting.<br>
